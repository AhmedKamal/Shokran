NAMING CONVENTIONS

1- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary
2- Always use self for the first argument to instance methods.
3- Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.
4- Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
5- Exception Names : the class naming convention applies here
6- Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words.



COMMENTS

1- Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!
